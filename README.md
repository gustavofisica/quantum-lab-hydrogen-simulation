# quantum-lab-hydrogen-simulation
Explore quantum mechanics in the browser. This app simulates the electron wave function of a Hydrogen atom. Switch between a 3D point cloud visualization and detailed 2D planar slices. Features full control over quantum numbers ($n, l, m$), axis visualization, and slice offsets to reveal the internal structure of orbitals.
